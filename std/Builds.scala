/** The organization of the implicit builders is a black art.
 *  It might be better to generate StdBuilds[0-15] and put an implicit in
 *  each one so the prioritization is as unambiguous as scala allows.
 *
 *  We adapt CanBuildFrom into our builder, since there are zillions of them lying
 *  around and it lets us build scala collections at the end of a view with no more code.
 *  Scala maps are built with Tuples even though Product2 should suffice; the types
 *  are written out as Tuple2[K, V] and not (K, V) to emphasize I'm using Tuple on purpose.
 *  The rest of the time one should write it K -> V.
